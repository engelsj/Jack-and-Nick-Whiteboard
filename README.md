# Flask Website

If i made still mistakes in this doccument feel free to edit or make comments in in here. I am super open to suggestions. If I am writing too much tell me. If I am writing to little, tell me. If I need to more precisise, tell me.


## Goals for tonight
1. We start by replciating this tutorial [Flask Blog](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MwZwr5Tvyxo)
- If we understand what he is doing we should just deploy and modify this github repository: [Repo](https://github.com/CoreyMSchafer/code_snippets/tree/master/Python/Flask_Blog). It might be a good idea to get working as fast as possible. We might need to race to an MVP
- If we find a better way to learn flask we can just copy the github repository and reverse engineer it to suit our needs.
 * This looks like it would be a viable alternative if we are prepared to sit down and just read a lot [Flask guide](http://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/1.1.x/)
2. We should be learning how flask works and how this specific tutorial is working, so we should **DOCUMENT** the process by which we are doing these things and clearly explain what everything we do does in some public document. Eventually we will pollish our doccumenation and make it the first thing we post on the website
 * I think we should document these processes at the bottom of this page in the next section labeled report progress
3. Nick needs to learn how branches work, so that he doesn't fuck anything up later
4. Nick needs to sort out the workflow and write out a plan in this document and for making edits to the website

## Report Progress to the goal here:
Nick
- Made more edits to readme
- Added "issues" which has just basically been a new way to add goals

Jack
- None

## Possible next steps
We need to find a method of deployment next. I would reccomend these depending on ultimate deployment:
1. Paying for hosting
- Netlify
- GH-pages
2. Frenom+netlify+travis
You are welcome to suggest other things. I would love to learn how to AWS, and I will have to learn in next semester so I am happy do that.

## What to do if we don't meet the goal by our deadline or do not think we can make the goals by the deadline(12/31/19)
1. We need to decide if we are doing to give it another day or if we should break the previous goals into smaller parts in consideration to what we have learned by making an attempt at our goals.

2. If we decide to break the goals into smaller goals we should
 * Get something running on our computer and learn how to reliably create a flask file that does this and understand why that works
 * Understand {% {{ coding what it is and what it does. Document the process
 * Get familiarity with bootstrap understand how it interacts with the html {{ coding }}

## Vision for the website

At the most **basic level** I want to have a website that lets me keep track of the work that I am doing every day and gets me in the habit of documenting everything that I am doing.

Being able to **Log In** and **Create Accounts** is goal that will make this website useable by other people. We will be able to share the website with other people who also want to share what they are doing everyday

Being able to **Add dynamic code** to demonstrate what we are doing is a stretch goal. This means being able to type in markdown when making posts on the website. (**Note** We should find a medium tutorial for adding this to flask, one certainly exists)

With enough time I would like this to be visible online so that **employers can see our collaborative enviroment** and **everything we have learned** working in that enviroment

Rambling: 
**SUPER STRETCH GOALS** ML, and Natural language processing for activies, sleep shedule and activity dictaiton. *ML powered social engine*. In other words i would like to hook up my echo dot to the website

## Ultimately this is a learning experience
1. We should use this as an opportunity to **explore** new technology. We should not just try to use stuff like AWS because it is the best, but because it is something new.

2. I hope that this is a basic way for two peope to log in and post what they are doing every day so that people stay commited to learning and working on projects

3. Being able to share with a more intimate group means that we will share more stuff and more interesting things. I would like this to be an opprotunity to do that.

# I don't think that what is below this line is super useful. But I would like it to brainstorm. 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Prototype of post that could go on the website

## Activities
- (need to fill with ideas and content here) Nothing so far 
## What I did today
- Easy time, date, location input (think voice assistant **stretch goal**)
### Example
- Today I woke up at 4:00 went for a walk to playland pier and walked back. I listened to music while walking.
- I went to get cofee at 5:15 at starbucks and then went to the ymca gym at 5:30. I erged and biked while there for 45mins and walked home
- I made breakfast using a bunch of onions, tomatos, water, salt, garlic, and a little beef. It tasted pretty good

## Sleep schedule elegant display
- If we can I would like to integrate a sleep scheduler with the activities portion of the website for deep personal importance

## Unrelated Activites Brainstorming (prototype of kind of post on website)
- Sports groups
- Ted talk viewinig parties
- Super smash bros tips and tricks
- Share and discuss Academic work that you are proud of(can only do because of intimacy of group/ size of group). 
- Video game and fantasy viewing parties
- DnD Campaigns

## Richard has shown interest in the project float involving him by richard and jack. Need a MVP before though, to establish precedent
## Start working on learning markdown better, so that these doccuments can have more features
- look at this guide https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/
- make note of how we can link topics as I this document can get really big
