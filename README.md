# Flask Website

## Goals for tonight
1. We start by replciating this tutorial [Flask Blog](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MwZwr5Tvyxo)
- This is the github repository: [Repo](https://github.com/CoreyMSchafer/code_snippets/tree/master/Python/Flask_Blog). If we understand what he is doing we should just deploy and modify this. It might be a good idea to get working as fast as possible. We might need to race to an MVP
- If we find a better way to learn flask we can just copy the github repository and reverse engineer it to suit our needs.
 * This looks like it would be a viable alternative if we are prepared to sit down and just read a lot [Flask guide](http://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/1.1.x/)
2. We should be learning how flask works and how this specific tutorial is working, so we should **DOCUMENT** the process by which we are doing these things and clearly explain what everything we do does in some public document. Eventually we will pollish our doccumenation and make it the first thing we post on the website
 * I think we should document these processes at the bottom of this page in the next section labeled report progress
3. Nick needs to learn how branches work, so that he doesn't fuck anything up later
4. Nick needs to sort out the workflow and write out a plan in this documen 

## Report Progress to the goal here:
Nick
-None
Jack
-None

## Possible next steps
We need to find a method of deployment next. I would reccomend these depending on ultimate deployment:
1. Paying for hosting
- Netlify
- GH-pages
2. Frenom+netlify+travis
You are welcome to suggest other things. I would love to learn how to AWS, and I will have to learn in next semester so I am happy do that.

## What to do if we don't meet the goal by our deadline or do not think we can make the goals by the deadline(12/31/19)
1. We need to decide if we are doing to give it another day or if we should break the previous goals into smaller parts in consideration to what we have learned by making an attempt at our goals.
2. If we decide to break the goals into smaller goals we should
 * Get something running on our computer and learn how to reliably create a flask file that does this and understand why that works
 * Understand {% {{ coding what it is and what it does. Document the process
 * Get familiarity with bootstrap understand how it interacts with the html {{ coding }}

## Vision for the website

At the most **basic level** I want to have a website that lets me keep track of the work that I am doing every day and gets me in the habit of documenting everything that I am doing.

Being able to **Log In** and **Create Accounts** is goal that will make this website useable by other people. We will be able to share the website with other people who also want to share what they are doing everyday

Being able to **Add dynamic code** to demonstrate what we are doing is a stretch goal

With enough time I would like this to be visible online so that **employers can see our collaborative enviroment** and **everything we have learned** working in that enviroment

## Ultimately this is a learning experience
1. We should use this as an opportunity to **explore** new technology. We should not just try to use stuff like AWS because it is the best, but because it is something new.

2. I hope that this is a basic way for two peope to log in and post what they are doing every day so that people stay commited to learning and working on projects
